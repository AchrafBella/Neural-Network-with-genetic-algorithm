Neural Networks with genetic algorithm
===========

Genetic algorithm and neural networks are both inspired by computation in biological system. A good deal of biological neural architecture is determined genetically. Neural networks and genetic algorithms are two techniques for optimization and learning, each having its own strengths and weaknesses.
In this project i work in the frame of The Ecole Centrale de Lyon in electif of Algorithmes collaboratifs 2019-2020 to build a nueral network that optmize its weights using genetic algorithms.


principle
-----------

- Create the population of the weights
- Fitness the weights using an activation functions
- Mesure the performance of the population (weights) by one of the metrics (MSE, RMSE)
- Select the best weights
- Crossover the best weights to produce new weights 
- Mutation to insure the convergence to the solution
